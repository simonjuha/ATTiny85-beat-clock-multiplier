## clock multiplier
This is a clock multiplier made for musical purpose, such as synthesizer/modular-systems or other things that would send out or receive 5v pulses. The current code is written for a ATTiny85, but should work fine on any Arduino etc.

The program measures the time between each pulse input, and outputs a repeating pulse with an interval defined by the variable 'mult'. There are 3 more inputs/outputs avalible if using and ATTiny85 these are currently used for changing mult, but could be replaced by an potentiometer for a wider range of tempos.
